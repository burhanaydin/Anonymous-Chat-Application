# Anonymous-Chat-Application For Linux
    This project aims to provide users with encryted communication utility over the internet. At first, all the users
have to download a peer-list xml file in order to set some network parameters and initialize communication. The program is very easy to use so everyone interested in can easily grab and run. But, because of a JNI bug, it now crashs with an JVM core dump message. I hope it will be available soon.
